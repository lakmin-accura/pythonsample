                    <h2 class="title-bar">About Us</h2>

                    <p>Camsoft was setup to help firms that donâ€™t have internal resources make informed IT decisions and to help them deliver their visions. </p>

                    <p>Setup in 2008 in Galway, Camsoft initially serviced the Legal industry in helping to streamline business processes embracing distributed technologies before the rise of the cloud. As our reputation grew there were further approaches from other sectors to help develop IT strategy and look at how technology could push their business forward. </p>

                    <p>We have worked on projects for large multinationals as well as small start ups. The common factor across all industries and projects is that we will make sure that our clients get the best of quality in a timely manner.</p>
